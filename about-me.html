            <h1>A few bits <span>about me</span>...</h1>
            <p>Hi there, my name is Oliver. Throughout my life I have had a vested interest in video games. 
                For as long as I can remember, I've been in love with the medium with a passion and interest that spills even outside of the game experiences themselves. 
                From reading eagerly about the latest upcoming developments and releases in magazines, to trawling through whatever breadcrumbs I could find about the development of my favourite titles, I've always been hooked.</p>
            <p>It's this interest that has given me the <span>lifelong goal of working within the video game industry as a Game Producer/Designer</span>. 
                With this in mind, I want to gain a bed of knowledge within coding and production and use that to attain experience and progress within the industry. 
                <span>I studied Computer Science throughout my GCSEs</span>, <span>learning Python and PHP</span>, and into my A-Levels. 
                With the latter ending prematurely, due to circumstances outside of my control, and not knowing where to pursue my interest further, the ambition had to take a backseat to realistic then-local options as I entered the world of work.</p>   
                <p>However, through the pandemic, I allowed my interest to be reinvigorated as I started once again consuming content more focused on game development - this time with more of a slant towards <span>design philosophies</span>. 
                This helped to inspire me and think more critically about why mechanics and design had been implemented in particular ways.</p>
            <p><span>My main inspiration is Masahiro Sakurai</span>, best known for being the creator of Kirby and Super Smash Bros. He also has his own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/sora_sakurai_en" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> where he discusses all manner of subjects relating to games, their design, and development. 
                Some of my favourite video game genres are JRPGs, Puzzle Games, and Professional Wrestling Games; with some of my favourite titles in each genre being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7OQymfl3qU"><span>Persona 5 Royal</span></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A88YiZdXugA"><span>Portal 2</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk3DoyfSm70"><span>Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Ōdō Keishō <em>(Royal Road Succession)</em></span></a>.</p>

            <h1>Hobbies <span>&</span> Interests</h1>
                <p>I am currently <span>learning Japanese</span> using online resources and textbooks. 
                    I was supposed to visit Japan in 2020, but my travel plans had to be abandoned due to COVID-19.</p>
                <p>I love <span>Sudoku</span> and other puzzles/problem-solving challenges.</p>
                <p>I spend a lot of my time <span>conceptualising video games</span> I would like to create in the future. 
                    This even spills into games I'm currently playing as I'll find myself making notes based on concepts I enjoy and would like to expand on or take inspiration from.</p>
                <p>When inspiration strikes me, I also like to <span>draw</span>. 
                    Usually my inspiration takes the form of professional wrestling, as it is such a colourful and dynamic medium.</p>
