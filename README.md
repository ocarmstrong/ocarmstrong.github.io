Oliver Armstrong Online CV

Hi everyone, this is my online porfolio.

This is the first website that I have published using HTML, CSS and JavaScript so any and all feedback will be happily welcomed.

This wasn't exactly what I had planned and I do have some implementations I would like to include/improve on in the future, such as:

* I want the contact page to either redirect you to your email application where it starts an email to me or to use a form to submit messages to me.
* I want the CV button to be able to download a copy of my CV to your device when clicked/tapped.
* I wanted to add a footer but time constraints meant I prioritised other implementations first.
* I want to make my Experience page more dynamic by featuring collapsible elements in a timeline, so you aren't bombarded by too much info.
* I was debating ditching some elements of my current Navigation Bar in favour of a simpler desktop design; featuring an icon link to my GitHub, the CV button and a collapsible list.


Thank you for viewing my website. As mentioned above, any and all feedback is welcome.
