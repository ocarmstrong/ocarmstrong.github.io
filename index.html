            <p>My name is Oliver. Whilst I haven't had any experience within the tech industry, I have prior experience working with programming through doing Computer Science at GCSE.</p>
            <p>My lifelong ambition is to work in the video games industry, with Game Producer/Designer being a target role of mine.
                With this in mind, I want to gain a bed of knowledge within coding and games production and use that to attain experience within industry.
                I am a big gamer, with my favourite genres being JRPGs and Professional Wrestling games. 
                My main inspiration is Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known as the creator of Kirby and Super Smash Bros. 
                He also has his own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/sora_sakurai_en" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> where he discusses all manner of subjects relating to games and game development.</p>
